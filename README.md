# chord-tutor
Practice playing chords - displays a window showing a chord symbol prompt (like you see in lead sheets), then monitors MIDI input to display what you actually played.
It's sort of like flashcards, but it shows if you are correct or not, then it gives you another random chord prompt. 
You can choose to practive Major & Minor triads, 7ths and inversions.

Python source code - uses pygame, MIDO MIDI library and music21 to figure out what chord you are playing
